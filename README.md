Description (Experiment-1: React Navigation Website) :

This experiment focuses on building a basic React-based Single Page Application (SPA) with multiple pages using React Router. The website includes three main pages: Home, About, and Contact,
which are displayed dynamically based on user interaction. Instead of loading separate HTML files, React updates only the required component, making the application faster and more efficient.

The project follows a component-based structure, where each page is written as an independent React component. This approach improves maintainability and allows easy future expansion. The App.js 
file acts as the central controller that manages navigation and routing between components.

Styling is implemented using external CSS, which enhances the visual appearance of the application through proper layout, color combinations, and hover effects. Overall, this experiment demonstrates
the fundamentals of React, including JSX, components, routing, and CSS integration, providing a strong foundation for modern front-end development.
